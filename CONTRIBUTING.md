1. Clone the code to your local machine
2. Create a branch with this name:

`git checkout -b <git-id>-<feature>`

3. Commit and push your branch like this:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "init"`

`git push origin <git-id>-<feature>`

4. Continue on your branch and do pull requests when ready (Make sure it compiles at least :D).
